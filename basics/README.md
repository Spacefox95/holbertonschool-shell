# Shell, basics

- What is the **shell** ?
 - What is the difference between a **terminal** and a **shell** ?
 - What is a **shell prompt** ?
 - How to use the **history** ?

## Objective

This project is dedicated to understand and learn the **shell**. The idea is to **create files** using the shell and manage to **write and test some little scripts**.

### Commands I used

>- cd
>- ls
>- pwd
>- less
>- file
>- ln
>- cp
>- mv
>- rm
>- mkdir
>- type
>- man
>>- ls -l
>>- ls -a
>> - cp -u
>>- rm -f
>- #!
 
## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line (why?)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
- You are not allowed to use backticks, `&&`, `||` or `;`
- All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the ==chmod== command: ==chmod u+x file==. Later, weâ€™ll learn more about how to utilize this command.
